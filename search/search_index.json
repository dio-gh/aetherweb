The app allows you to play games that you have dumped from disc on your phone with external or touchscreen controls. It is free to use and does not contain ads. The app is relatively new, but hopefully the updates released so far demonstrate our competency and ability to continue to improve. However, as this project is just a hobby for us, and the app is free, we do not have the funds to purchase additional devices for performance improvements and bug fixing. Please keep this in mind before reaching out to us. Funding and support We have however created a crowdfunding page that exists as a fundraiser for acquiring additional devices, and paying for hosting so that users outside of the Play Store can still download the app. We have no interest in making any profit at all, only the cost of devices. Asking for assistance with devices alone is uncomfortable enough, but we simply can't afford to buy them ourselves out of pocket. Therefore, if you'd like to support the cause, please consider supporting us on Patreon. Community spaces We maintain two public-facing community spaces at this point in time. The first would be our subreddit , where people can engage in a forum-like experience. The second would be our Discord server , that allows for more immediate-type communication and quick troubleshooting. Feel free to join to both, if you'd like to hang out.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#project-overview","text":"AetherSX2 is the reimplementation of a well-known desktop PS2 emulator for the ARMv8/AArch64 platform, as well as a frontend/app for Android.

Google Play We recommend installing the app from Google Play. This ensures we receive any crash reports, and you are automatically updated to the latest version. APK Download Since December 28, 2021 you can download an APK version of AetherSX2 if your device does not support Google Play. We do not recommend the APK installation. You should use the Play Store link to ensure you have the latest version. Additionally, no community support will be provided for users who install from APK. If your device is not supported in the Play Store version, it is likely too slow to run AetherSX2. Link to APK archive: https://www.aethersx2.com/archive/ Update Notes There are glitches in the Vulkan renderer after the update. Some Adreno drivers are broken. Turn on the \"Disable Texture Barriers\" option in Advanced Settings to revert to the old behavior. I have worse performance. Reset settings.

The console is an extremely complex piece of hardware, with many very powerful components, even for today. You need a high end device to achieve good performance. We recommend at least a Snapdragon 845-equivalent device. This means 4 large cores (Cortex-A75 level). If you only have two big cores (e.g. Snapdragon 700 series SoCs, you should not enable multi-threaded VU, and performance will suffer as a result). Devices with Mali or PowerVR GPUs will run the app, but performance will be lower than Adreno GPUs. If you want to use the app on a slower device, you can try it, but games will run slow, especially heavier titles. You can try underclocking the CPU by setting the cycle rate to a negative number, and the cycle skip to a positive number in System settings, but this will cause games to lag internally at best, or crash at worst. Expectations. This is a free app, worked on as a hobby in the developer\u2019s free time. At the time of writing, it is in very early stages and missing many useful features, however is usable for playing some games. It is not going to be perfect, far from it. I will continue to improve it when I have time, but please remember this is not my job, and to have realistic expectations, especially if you do not have a high end device. As it is an early preview, you should save your game regularly in case of crashes. The app tells me I need a BIOS. Yes, you do. A BIOS image is required to play games and is not optional. This image should be dumped from your own console, using a homebrew application. There are plenty of guides available online on how to dump your console\u2019s BIOS. My games are running slow/lagging. Different games have very different hardware requirements, due to how much they utilized the various components of the console. You can try underclocking the CPU by setting the cycle rate to a negative number, and the cycle skip to a positive number in System settings, but this will cause games to lag internally at best, or crash at worst. How to improve performance? Make sure fastmem is enabled in System settings. Enable Multi-Threaded VU1 in System settings. This will cause lower performance if your device does not have at least three \"big\" CPU cores. Use the Vulkan renderer if you have an Adreno GPU. Note that some games will perform better with OpenGL, and may not render correctly with Vulkan. Mali GPUs are not tested with the Vulkan renderer. Underclock the emulated CPU by setting the cycle rate to a negative number, and cycle skip to a positive number in System settings. For some games, enabling the Preload Textures and GPU Palette conversion options in Graphics settings can improve performance. If the game slows down depending on the camera angle, this may be due to GS downloads, which are very slow on mobile GPUs. You can try disabling hardware readbacks in Graphics options, but this may create some glitches in effects. How do I customize the touchscreen controller (position/scale)? Press the pause or back button while ingame, and tap the controls tab in the top-right corner. You can also add additional buttons for hotkeys here, e.g. fast forward, quick load/save, etc. The app opens in portrait mode, how do I change it to landscape? Turn your device around if you have auto rotation enabled. You can also force it to always use landscape in the first page of App Settings. My Bluetooth controller isn\u2019t working. Map the controller in \"Controller Settings\". You can start with the automatic mapping, but sometimes triggers or sticks still need to be mapped manually. I want to set different settings for each game. Long press the game in the game list/grid, tap Game Properties, and tap the Game Settings tab. If you want to change these settings while in-game, open the pause menu, and tap the info button in the top-right corner to access Game Properties. My games have rendering glitches. Due to the complexity of the console\u2019s hardware, there are still plenty of issues which arise when using the hardware renderer. You can try using the software renderer for these games. I want to save more than one state. Open the pause menu and tap Load/Save state, there are 10 slots + a quick save (for onscreen buttons). I want copy my saves from another device. Currently you can only import an entire memory card at once; it is not possible to import individual saves. Swiping from the left in the game list will show an \"Import Memory Card\" option which you can use to import a *.ps2 image of a memory card. Where are my saves located? Due to scoped storage on Android 11+, we cannot place your saves in a normal directory on external storage. However, with a file explorer app, you should be able to access the Android/data/xyz.aethersx2.android directory, in your primary storage volume, which contains your save states and memory cards. Note that accessing this directory requires granting additional permissions to your file manager on Android 11+. How do I add covers to the game grid? Place cover images in the covers directory, located in the data directory mentioned above, with the file name as the game title or serial in jpg/png format. Alternatively, you can long press in the game list and select \"Choose Cover Image\" to import an image. How do I create launcher shortcuts for games? Long press the game in the game list, and select \"Create Launcher Shortcut\".","title":"What are the requirements?"},{"location":"FAQ/what-are-the-requirements/#what-are-the-requirements","text":"The console is an extremely complex piece of hardware, with many very powerful components, even for today.
