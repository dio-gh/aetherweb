# How do I get it?

## Google Play

We recommend installing the app from Google Play. This ensures we receive any crash reports, and you are automatically updated to the latest version.

## APK Download

Since December 28, 2021 you can download an APK version of AetherSX2 if your device does not support Google Play.

**We do not recommend the APK installation. You should use the Play Store link to ensure you have the latest version.**

Additionally, **no community support will be provided for users who install from APK.** If your device is not supported in the Play Store version, it is likely too slow to run AetherSX2.

## Update Notes

> **There are glitches in the Vulkan renderer after the update.**

Some Adreno drivers are broken. Turn on the "Disable Texture Barriers" option in Advanced Settings to revert to the old behavior.

> **I have worse performance.**

Reset settings. Make sure texture preloading is enabled, and conservative buffer allocation is also enabled.
