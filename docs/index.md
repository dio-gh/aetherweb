# Introduction

## Project overview

AetherSX2 is the reimplementation of a [well-known desktop PS2 emulator](https://pcsx2.net/) for the ARMv8/AArch64 platform, as well as a frontend/app for Android. The app allows you to play games that you have dumped from disc on your phone with external or touchscreen controls. It is free to use and does not contain ads.

The app is relatively new, but hopefully the updates released so far demonstrate our competency and ability to continue to improve. However, as this project is just a hobby for us, and the app is free, we do not have the funds to purchase additional devices for performance improvements and bug fixing. Please keep this in mind before reaching out to us.

## Funding and support

We have however created a crowdfunding page that exists as a fundraiser for acquiring additional devices, and paying for hosting so that users outside of the Play Store can still download the app. We have no interest in making any profit at all, only the cost of devices. Asking for assistance with devices alone is uncomfortable enough, but we simply can't afford to buy them ourselves out of pocket.

Therefore, if you'd like to support the cause, please consider supporting us [on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/aethersx2)

## Community spaces

We maintain two public-facing community spaces at this point in time. The first would be [our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AetherSX2/), where people can engage in a forum-like experience. The second would be [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/JZ7BkeEdrJ), that allows for more immediate-type communication and quick troubleshooting.

Feel free to join to both, if you'd like to hang out.
